                  With the cost of energy going to continue to increase a $200
                  electric bill today could be $300 in 2-3 years. How about
                  paying $500 for the same amount? No one can predict what can
                  happen. We are all forced to pay whatever they say. They have
                  a natural monopoly for delivering electricity to most homes.

                  grid is not able to handle the amount of electricity we are

              <p>
                For most people, electricity bills are just a fact of life. We
                need electricity for many of the essential aspects of modern
                life – everything from air conditioning and kitchen appliances
                to TVs and cell phones require it. Electric vehicles are
                becoming more normal every day and we are seeing homeowners’
                consumption of electricity increasing significantly with that as
                well. Here are some of the major benefits homeowners are taking
                advantage of by switching to solar.

                      Solar saves homeowners’ money on their monthly electric
                      bills immediately. It also protects them against rising
                      utility costs and provides a much more predictable billing
                      cycle which avoids nasty unexpected bills.

                      Not only are electric rates high now, but they continue to
                      increase over time. Increases in electric rates far
                      outpace inflation and wage growth, meaning that everyday
                      Americans are spending an increasing share of their income

                      The clean energy produced by solar panels quickly
                      compensates for the energy required to manufacture them.
                      Combined with other positive environmental impacts such as
                      reductions in water usage, homeowners can rest assured
                      that their solar panels have a substantial positive effect
                      on the environment.

                      It’s important that every residential solar system has a
                      monitoring system. This is the system that will allow you
                      to view and measure real-time and historical energy
                      production data of your system. We will audit your
                      monitoring system FREE of charge to ensure your solar
                      array is producing what it should be.

              Solar saves homeowners’ money on their monthly electric bills
              immediately. It also protects them against rising utility costs
              and provides a much more predictable billing cycle which avoids
              nasty unexpected bills.

              How Does Solar Work For Your Home
            </h2>
            <p>
              Essentially what happens is that solar panels record the sun’s
              energy and then work to convert that energy into power for your
              home. After sunlight hits solar panels, it’s captured within
              photovoltaic cells and transported to an inverter where it’s
              converted from direct current DC electricity to usable AC
              electricity. From there, the electricity is ready to be used by
              you and your home or is sent out to the grid to be used by your
              neighbors. In some other cases, the power might be stored in
              battery banks
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">

                <div class="bg-secondary bg-opacity-10 text-center p-2 rounded">
                  <p>
                    Excess solar power above storage capacity is exported to the
                    grid. Your power provider will compensate you for the energy
                    your home system produces.

                    Light photons from the sun are absorbed by the solar panels
                    on your roof, which generates a direct current (DC).
